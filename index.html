            <h1>Leading Causes of Death in California (1999-2012)</h1>
            <p>Enter a zip code to view and compare the distribution in that area.</p>

            <p>In general, if the top of a bar is blue, the corresponding cause of death is proportionately higher than the California average. If it is pink, it is lower than average.</p>

            <blockquote>
            1999-2012 deaths of California residents by ZIP code: Cause-of-death data for 1989 through 1998 were coded using the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases codes (ICD-9), while data for 1999 and onward were coded using the Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Deaths are tracked by residence, not occurrence, so a California resident who resided in a California ZIP code would be counted for that ZIP code, even if the death occurred somewhere else (including outside of California). Conversely, a visitor from outside California who died in the state would not be counted in this table.
